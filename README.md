Installing Blynk Library in Arduino IDE
1.	Open Arduino IDE and go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
2.	Search for Blynk and install the Blynk by Volodymyr Shymanskyy library.
How the Code Works
1.	Blynk Configuration:
o	Replace the placeholders with your Template ID, Device Name, and Auth Token from the Blynk dashboard.
2.	Wi-Fi Setup:
o	Connect the ESP32 to a Wi-Fi network by entering your credentials.
3.	LED Control:
o	The BLYNK_WRITE function listens to changes in the virtual pin (V0) from the Blynk app.
o	The LED state is updated based on the button widget's input (ON/OFF).
